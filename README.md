## What?
This is a **very** basic website made solely towards to completion of the freecodecamp specifications.

Most good practices ARE NOT followed. However, there's still a nice deploy script just in case this gets forked.
No CI support is implemented or planned.
It's really very basic.

You can check it out [here](haozeke.github.io/FreeCodeCamp_Tribute)

A much more involved WIP using jekyll and webpack2 can be found [here](github.com/HaoZeke/Tribute)

### Lemme Edit!
I suggest forking and using the deploy script...
Simple as this is you may also simply copy the relevant files into CodePen.
